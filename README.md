🔄 full Software Development Lifecycle
      
 
## 📔 Phase 1: Requirements Gathering & Information Research (Sprint 1)
**Agile Methodologies** used:


•	**Face to face communication**. When gathering requirements, it is better to speak with a human instead of communicating through emails. 

•	**Working software over comprehensive documetation**. Would you rather have an application that FUNCTIONS correctly instead of having a large set of rules that are too confusing to follow for implementation?

•	**Individuals and interactions over process and tools**. It is a great practice to focus on the - "who is helping us with this?" Over "Does it work yet? Or not..... Creativity is the birth child of brainstorming by collaborating with collegues who may have different sources of knowledge and experience that can prove to be usefull throughout the process!
